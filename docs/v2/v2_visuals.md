Below is a **serious, trust-first color system**.
No hype. No “marketplace dopamine”. This signals **credibility, restraint, and accountability**.

---

## Core Principle

Trust platforms must look:

* Calm
* Neutral
* Almost boring
  Because **boring = safe**.

If it looks “growthy”, trust drops.

---

## Primary Palette (Base)

### 1) Background — *Paper, not plastic*

* **Off-white / Warm gray**

  * `#FAFAF8` or `#F7F7F5`

Why:

* Feels like documents, contracts, records
* Reduces cognitive load
* Lets data breathe

---

### 2) Primary Text — *Ink*

* **Near-black**

  * `#111111` or `#141414`

Never pure black.
Pure black feels aggressive.

---

### 3) Secondary Text — *Muted authority*

* **Cool gray**

  * `#6B7280`

Used for:

* Explanations
* Metadata
* Dates
* Legal hints

---

## Trust Accent (Very Important)

### 4) Trust Blue — *Institutional*

* **Deep muted blue**

  * `#1F3A5F` or `#243A5E`

Use sparingly:

* Section headers
* “How trust works”
* Trust Manifesto titles
* Selected farmer badge

This color says:

> “Records are kept here.”

---

## Status Colors (Non-negotiable)

### 5) Success — *Quiet green*

* `#2F6F4E`

Used for:

* Delivered
* Completed
* Verified

No neon. No celebration.

---

### 6) Failure — *Cold red*

* `#8B2E2E`

Used for:

* Failed delivery
* Missed commitment
* Suspension

Rules:

* Always visible
* Never softened
* Never hidden behind tooltips

Failure visibility = trust multiplier.

---

### 7) Warning / Pending — *Dusty amber*

* `#9A6B1E`

Used for:

* Upcoming delivery
* Pending confirmation

---

## Buttons (critical restraint)

### Primary Action

* Background: Trust Blue
* Text: White
* Radius: Small (4–6px)
* No gradients
* No shadows

### Secondary Action

* Outline only
* Gray border
* Transparent background

Never use:

* Bright green “Buy now”
* Orange urgency buttons
* Animated pulses

---

## What to AVOID (strict)

❌ Neon colors
❌ Crypto purple / electric blue
❌ Gradients
❌ Glassmorphism
❌ Dark mode as default (optional later)

Dark mode hides accountability.
Light mode exposes records.

---

## Emotional Outcome You Want

User thinks:

> “This feels like a public registry, not an app trying to sell me something.”

Farmers think:

> “My name is on record here.”

That’s seriousness.

---

## One-line rule for the dev

> If a color makes the UI feel exciting, remove it.
