Correct. Long text is ignored unless **design forces meaning before reading**.
Below is a **sharp, opinionated wireframe plan**. Minimal text. High signal. No fluff.

---

## HOMEPAGE (single-scroll, narrative)

### 1) Hero (above the fold)

**Purpose:** instant positioning

**Hero copy (3 lines max):**

> **Buy rice directly from the farmer.**
> No middlemen. No platform payments.
> **Trust built in public.**

**Primary CTA:**
`View available harvests`

**Secondary CTA (soft):**
`How trust works →`

No story yet. Just clarity.

---

### 2) “How Trust Works” (visual, 3 steps)

Icons + 1 line each.

1. **Selected farmers only**
   Invite-only. Real people. Real farms.

2. **Public commitments**
   Quantity and delivery dates are recorded.

3. **Permanent track record**
   Delivery outcomes stay visible.

CTA under this section:
`See a farmer profile`

---

### 3) Live Commitments (core content)

This is the homepage **meat**.

Cards show:

* Farmer name + region
* Quantity
* Delivery window
* Status badge: `Open / Delivered / Failed (rare but visible)`

Clicking card → seller profile.

---

### 4) Trust Manifesto (short, sharp)

**Not a section. A block.**

Title:

> **Our role is trust — nothing else.**

4 bullets max:

* We don’t handle money
* We don’t sell rice
* We make commitments public
* We never hide failures

CTA:
`Read the full story →`

---

### 5) Footer (where legal lives)

* Story
* Trust Manifesto
* Terms & Responsibility
* Contact

Legal text never pollutes trust UI.

---

## SELLER PROFILE PAGE (trust page, not marketing)

### Top (identity first)

* Real name
* Region (map dot)
* “Selected farmer”
* Years farming

No banners. No slogans.

---

### Commitment History (most important)

Table or timeline:

* Date
* Quantity
* Expected delivery
* Outcome: Delivered / Failed

Failures:

* Red
* Visible
* Undeletable

This is the deterrent.

---

### Current Listings

Simple cards:

* Quantity
* Delivery window
* Reserve button

---

### “Why this farmer is here”

2–3 sentences max. Human, not promo.

---

## BUYER ACTION FLOW (buttons matter)

Buttons shown:

* `Reserve harvest`
* `Contact farmer`
* `View commitment history`

**No “Buy now”**
**No payment language**

Trust > urgency.

---

## STICKY HEADER (always visible)

Left: Logo
Center (small):

> *Curated farmers. Public commitments.*

Right:

* View harvests
* How trust works
* Story

No login CTA unless required.

---

## MENU ITEMS (keep it opinionated)

* Harvests
* Farmers
* How Trust Works
* Story
* Terms & Responsibility

Nothing else.

---

## WHERE EACH CONCEPT LIVES (clear mapping)

| Concept                | Where                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Trust Manifesto        | Homepage block + dedicated page              |
| Story / Why            | Dedicated page, linked from hero & manifesto |
| Terms / Responsibility | Footer only                                  |
| Platform role          | Hero + How Trust Works                       |
| Founder identity       | Story page (not homepage)                    |
| Accountability         | Seller profile + commitments                 |

---

## CRITICAL DESIGN RULES (do not break)

* **Failures must be more visible than success**
* **No trust claims without proof**
* **No guarantees language**
* **Name + face > brand claims**
* **History beats testimonials**

---

## Final hard truth

If this feels “too honest” or “too exposed”:

* It’s working
* Bad actors will self-select out
* Good buyers will lean in

This is not a marketplace.
It’s a **trust machine**.
